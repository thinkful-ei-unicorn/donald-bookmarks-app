Live link to the bookmark-app:
 https://thinkful-ei-unicorn.github.io/donald-bookmarks-app/.

A user can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title url link description rating (1-5) A user can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating A user can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link A user can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

A user will receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required) A user can select from a dropdown (a element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
